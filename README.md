For the record im all self taught school is literally the most pointless thing to ever be created in this world, i was forced to go to post-secondary and graduated with a 3.9 GPA in network engineering, network security, virtualization, cloud server admin, etc. 
If you have to go to school to learn something you dont want it bad enough. I am still studying the architect portions of everything in cyber, network, and cloud. I am open to jobs and am looking myself. I will post my code for a vewing in my github. I taught myself for not too long of a time, at the end of the day its how bad do you want it and to be great, welcome to my journey, please refer to me as my alias "Reaper".
